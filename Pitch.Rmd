## MPG prediction through linear regression in the mtcars data

MPG prediction for the final project in the developing data products course using shiny apps and RMarkDown.


## App Overview

- Miles  per galon can be estimated through several features present in the database.
- Displacement, number of gears, weight, type of transmission and horse power are some charaterics that we know can influence a cars fuel consuptiom
- The created app allows to estimate the MPG of a hypotetical car based on these characteristics

## Data Used
The data used for this application is the mtcaras data set, which is part of the datasets package.
mtcars
From datasets v3.6.2
